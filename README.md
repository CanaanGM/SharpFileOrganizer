# FileOrganizer

same purpose as my [python-FileOrganizer](https://github.com/CanaanGM/FileOrganizers) but in c#

for 2 reasons:
- i tried to see if i could improve the script
- i found the performance to be a huge jump from python from 4053.0706 -> 381.2566 Milliseconds. and that with the code still needs optimization xD
